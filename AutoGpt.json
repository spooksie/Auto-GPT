And half of Instagram users say the platform helps them discover new brands. Even better for brands, 44% of users shop weekly on the platform.\nIf you’re not using Instagram for business purposes, those potential new customers might never find their way to your products or services.\nHere’s how to use Instagram for business growth in 2023.\nBonus: Claim your free pack of 15 creative Instagram post templates made by Hootsuite’s professional graphic designers. Easily customize them in Canva, and start getting more engagement today.\nHow to set up Instagram for business in 4 steps\n1. Switch to a Business account\nYou need to create an Instagram account first, then convert it to a business account. If you have an existing personal or creator account you want to convert, that works too. It’s free and anyone can do it.\nYou can have up to five Instagram accounts, so go ahead and keep your personal Instagram account personal if that’s what you prefer.\nFrom your profile, tap the hamburger (three lines) menu icon in the upper-right corner.\nTap Settings. Some accounts may see Switch to professional account on this menu. If you do, tap it. Otherwise, tap Account, then tap Switch to professional account.\nTap Continue (you may need to tap it multiple times as Instagram previews the available features of a professional account).\nSelect a Category and use the slider to choose whether to show it on your profile, then tap Done.\nChoose Business (unless it makes sense for you to choose Creator), and tap Next.\nUse the slider to opt in or out of promotional emails from Instagram for professional accounts, then tap Next.\nAdd or edit relevant contact details, then use the slider to choose whether to show your contact information on your profile, then tap Next (or tap Don’t use my contact info to skip this step).\nIf you plan to connect your Instagram business account with a Facebook business page, follow the prompts to connect your account to your Facebook Page. This is technically optional, but it’s necessary in order to use Instagram shopping features or run ads on Instagram.\nTap the X in the top left corner to close this window and return to your profile.\nLearn more about the difference between Instagram business and creator accounts.\n2. Add business information to your bio\nIn 150 characters or less, your Instagram bio should describe your brand and showcase your brand voice. We’ve got a full guide to creating an effective Instagram bio for business (complete with templates), but here’s a quick video to walk you through the basics:\nAlso be sure to make the most of the other components of your Instagram business profile:\nProfile pic: Most brands use their logo. Your profile photo displays as 110 x 110 pixels (cropped to a circle), but it’s stored at 320 x 320, so that’s the size you should upload.\nLink in bio: Link to your website, your latest blog post, a current campaign or a Link Tree.\nContact information: If you didn’t add contact info during your account creation, you can do so at any time by tapping Edit profile. Instagram will then add a Contact button to your profile.\nAction buttons: If relevant, you can add a button that allows customers to book or reserve appointments or to order food. To use this feature, you need an account with one of Instagram’s partners. Tap Edit Profile, then scroll down to Action Buttons.\nStory highlights and covers: Instagram Story highlights are another way to maximize your profile real estate by providing more information about your brand or your products. Organize Stories into saved collections, then add some polish with Highlight covers.\n3. Connect your product catalog\nTo tag products in Instagram content, or to run certain kinds of Instagram ads, you need to create a product catalog. You can do this in Meta’s Commerce Manager.\nHead to Commerce Manager and click Get Started, then select Create a catalog and click Get started again.\nSelect Ecommerce, then click Next.\nIf you have a shop on an ecommerce platform like Shopify or Big Commerce, click Connect a partner platform and follow the prompts to create your catalog. Otherwise, click Upload product info, name your catalog and click Next.\nClick View catalog to open your catalog, then Add items to start adding products.\nWe’ve got a whole post on using Commerce Manager if you’d like more details on how this tool works.\n4. Turn on Instagram shopping\nOnce your catalog is full of products, it’s time to turn on Instagram’s shopping features.\nFrom your profile, tap the hamburger (three lines) menu icon in the upper-right corner.\nTap Settings, then Business, then Set up a Shop.\nTap Get started and follow the prompts to submit your shop for review.\nWait for approval. You can check the status of your shop at any time by going to Settings > Business >Shopping.\nOnce your shop is approved, go to Settings > Business >Shopping, select your product catalog and tap Done.\nWe’ve got a full blog post explaining everything you need to know about Instagram Shopping if you want to focus on this particular aspect of using Instagram for business.\nUsing Instagram for business: 6 tips\n1. Research your audience\nA good social media strategy starts with a sound understanding of your audience.\nInstagram’s audience demographics give you an overall picture of who uses the platform. For example, 18-34-year-olds represent the largest ad audience on the site.\nSource: Hootsuite Global State of Digital 2022 (October Update)\nHowever, that doesn’t mean your specific audience on Instagram will be made up of 18-to-34-year-olds. For example, looking at the audience insights for my own Instagram account, I can see that my audience skews older than the Instagram average:\nSource: Meta Business Suite","Source: https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-use-instagram-for-business/\nContent summary part#1: The text provides information on how to set up and use Instagram for business growth in 2023, including switching to a business account, adding business information to your bio, connecting your product catalog, and turning on Instagram shopping. The text also highlights the importance of researching your audience for a successful social media strategy.","Source: https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-use-instagram-for-business/\nRaw content part#2: You can find demographic information on your existing audience using Instagram Insights, Meta Business Suite, or Hootsuite Analytics. But if you’re just getting started using Instagram for business, you might not have a large enough following to gain meaningful insights here yet.\nIn that case, take a look at the demographics of your audience on other social channels and of your existing customer base. While this won’t translate exactly to Instagram, it should give you a sense of who’s interested in your business and what you have to say.\nUnderstanding your audience puts you in a better position to create targeted content and business captions for Instagram that resonate. Since audience research is an important foundation for your content strategy, we’ve got a whole post dedicated to helping you find your target market.\n2. Figure out your content mix\nNow that you know who your audience is, you need to determine what to share with them. Rather than posting random content whenever the mood strikes, you need to develop a content strategy that speaks to your audience and keeps them engaged, all while contributing to real business goals.\nWhile you should certainly post some promotional content to get people excited about your products and drive sales, you also need to provide content that builds community and sparks engagement.\nThat might mean including user-generated content or other curated resources, sharing insider expertise about your industry, or joining in on a trending meme. (But tread carefully here – only join in on trends that are appropriate for your brand voice.)\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Wendy's 🍔 (@wendys)\nLook for opportunities to develop themes or regular installments that you can build into a series. “Content buckets” allow you to check certain boxes without having to overthink creation. The more planning you do upfront, the better you’ll be able to produce regular content and respond to last-minute or unplanned events.\n3. Schedule your content in advance\nFrom Reels to Stories to posts, there are many options when it comes to Instagram content.\nThe best way to create a unified strategy is to schedule your content across all Instagram surfaces (and other social platforms) using a content calendar. Or, take it up a level and schedule all your content to publish automatically at the right time using a tool like the Hootsuite Publisher. Yes, you can even schedule Stories and Reels in advance.\nStart free 30-day trial\nThe added advantage here is that you can create your content in dedicated blocks of time and schedule it to post at the best time for your audience. Even if that time is outside business hours, on the weekend, or in the middle of the night.\n4. Tag products\nWhen you share content about your products on Instagram, tagging makes it much easier for people to learn more or buy. You can tag up to 20 products in a photo feed post.\nTo tag products, create your Instagram post or Reel as usual. Then, on the final screen before posting, tap Tag products. You can tag products from your own shop or someone else’s, which creates great opportunities for collaboration and cross-promotion.\nSource: @reitmans\nIn Stories, you can tag products using the Product link sticker.\nSource: @allbirds\n5. Track your results (and learn from wins and losses)\nWith an Instagram business profile, you have access to the platform’s built-in analytics tools to help you understand how well different types of content perform.\nThere are several other analytics tools available, including Hootsuite’s, that can track longer time frames, automate reporting and make it easier to compare Instagram metrics across other social media platforms.\nTry for free\nNo matter which social media marketing tools you use, the important thing is to check in regularly to learn what kind of content resonates best with your target audience. You’ll start to see patterns about what generates the most engagement, as well as what kinds of social media content increase views beyond your existing follower base. (Hint: Try Instagram Reels.)\nUse these lessons to hone your content strategy over time.\n6. Treat Instagram as a customer service channel\nSuccess on Instagram requires you to engage with your followers rather than just blast content out and hope someone likes it. One important component of this two-way communication is monitoring your DMs for questions, comments, and customer service requests.\nInstagram business accounts have access to a couple of DM features that make managing customer service easier on the platform. First, your inbox is divided into Primary and General tabs to make it easier to keep track of your messages. And second, you can create saved replies to commonly asked questions that you can access via keyboard shortcuts.\nHootsuite Inbox makes it even easier to manage your DMs by allowing you to assign messages to the appropriate team members. If you really want to take customer service on Instagram seriously, a tool like Sparkcentral allows you to integrate Instagram with your CRM.\nFAQs about using Instagram for business\nIs Instagram free for business?\nIt’s free to set up an Instagram business account, promote your business, and even set up an Instagram shop.\nThe only fees for Instagram business accounts are ad costs if you choose to run Instagram ads, and selling fees if you use Commerce Manager to allow your customers to check out and complete their purchase within the Meta platform.\nSo, there is no fee to use Instagram Shopping to tag products and direct users to your website to buy them. However, if you use Meta’s native checkout through Commerce Manager, you will pay the following selling fees:\n$0.40 for shipments up to $8.00\n5% for shipments of $8.01 or more\nInstagram is waiving these fees until 11:59 PST June 30, 2023.\nHow does Instagram work for business?\nAs you’ve seen in the Instagram for business tips throughout this post, Instagram offers many useful features for businesses. Some of the most important features only available for professional accounts are:\nInstagram Insights for audience demographics and details about how your content performs\nInstagram Shopping to tag products in your content\nInstagram Direct features to better manage DM communications\nBut on the whole, Instagram for businesses works just like it works for creators or personal accounts. Create great content that inspires, informs, or entertains your audience to grow your following and build community around your account.\nWhat are the disadvantages of using Instagram for business?\nFor most businesses, the benefits of using Instagram for business far outweigh the disadvantages. That said, there is one important disadvantage that’s especially important when using Instagram for small business development.\nFor micro businesses, it can be tempting to use Instagram as your entire business presence. But this puts you at risk if you ever have an issue with your account, like being hacked, locked out, or blocked. It’s a good idea to also have a website you control where you can continue to make sales and grow your audience if there’s ever a problem with your Instagram business account.\nSave time managing Instagram for business using Hootsuite.

So, What do you want your visual content to say about your brand?\nNot only should you consider posting more photos and videos on social media, but a great platform for engaging with your content is Instagram. With over 400 million active daily users, Instagram usage has doubled in the last two years.\nWhile Instagram might not be the right social platform for every brand, engagement with brands on Instagram is 84 times higher than Twitter and 10 times higher than its own parent company, Facebook.While generating leads and driving traffic is difficult with its lack of links, Instagram is an amazing platform for displaying your company’s culture and brand.\nWhat should you be doing to increase engagement across your posts?\nKeep Content Fresh, Beautiful, Interactive, and Aligned with Your Brand\nJust like any content you would put on your site make sure your Instagram is fresh, beautiful, interactive, and aligned with the image you want for your brand. Your posts on Instagram should feel relevant.\nFor example, it wouldn't make sense for a bakery to have images of someone surfing on the beach or another of a steak. They don't fit with the products and services the organization provides.\nSome ways you can keep your content fresh and interactive is by using Instagram’s new features:\nStories\nLive video\nBulk upload\nAll of those features are great options where brands can easily highlight company events and conferences and overall go a bit deeper with the content they share.\nWhile you don’t necessarily need to post on Instagram every hour or even every day. It’s a popular platform for showing your audience what’s happening around your office and highlighting new products or promotions.\nSome ways that we use Instagram is to highlight team building exercises such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (IMPACT Style), and celebrations like Employee Appreciation and Dip Day. We also, use Instagram to highlight events we’ve attended (INBOUND, Conversion XL) and events we’re running (BMSS and our upcoming event IMPACT Live).\nOverall, it’s a highly engaging and concise way to give people a peek into you daily routines.\nUse Bulk Upload to Tell a Story\nEveryone loves a good story! So why not tell a story with the images you’re putting on your Instagram.\nCreate different image galleries where you can showcase images from particular events or campaigns. You can do that by bulk uploading up to 10 photos to one social post.\nLet your brand tell a story.\nAnd, don’t forget to use video. Some great add-on apps you can use when posting images and videos include:\nLayout\nBoomerang\nHyperlapse\nSwipeable\nIf you need help coming up with a catchy caption, check out Captiona\nGet Your Customers Involved\nWith over 500 million active monthly users, it’s no surprise the platform is used by 48.8% of brands -- and it doesn’t hurt that consumers and users on Instagram upload somewhere up to 40 million photos a day!\nWouldn’t you want to find a way to get your audience involved in your content creation? Instagram users enjoy taking photos of brands and companies they love.\nSome ways you can involve your audience include creating unique a hashtag your followers can use when posting photos of your brand and products. You can even then comment on those photos and even post your favorites to your account.\nA few brands that have effectively implementing this strategy include IPSY and Instagram’s company account.\nDirect Traffic In Your Caption\nDespite barring links from its captions, did you know that compelling images on your Instagram page could actually drive more traffic to your website?\nLocowise found that 75% of Instagram users take action, such as visiting a website, after looking at an Instagram advertising post.\nKnowing this, instead of just posting a random photo or video, use it to grab the attention of your viewer and direct them to your website where you can create an deeper engagement with your visitors.\nUnfortunately, you can’t add a link directly to each post, but you can direct your audience to the link in your bio.\nHere’s a look at 21 brands that are effectively engaging with their audience on Instagram!\n1. Tentsile\nFor those of you interested in being suspended between the trees, Tentsile is an adventurous brand to follow.\nOne thing, you’ll notice about a majority of their posts is that they are user generated.\nYou can take a sneak peek into how users are taking advantage of the space around them.\nThey also use their Instagram posts to promote any sales that they’re having, by mentioning the promo code in the posts caption.\n2. Nike\nNike is an inspiring brand for aspiring and professional athletes.\nYou won’t find their Instagram a stream of athletic sneakers, but highlighting record breaking sports highlights, influential sports moments, and inspiring athletes to keep doing what they love.","Source: https://www.impactplus.com/blog/examples-of-businesses-using-instagram\nContent summary part#1: The text provides tips for businesses to effectively use Instagram to engage with their audience and promote their brand. It also includes examples of brands, such as Tentsile and Nike, that use Instagram to showcase their products and connect with their followers. However, it does not provide a specific answer to the question of businesses that primarily use Instagram.","Source: https://www.impactplus.com/blog/examples-of-businesses-using-instagram\nRaw content part#2: I love that they’re using Instagram to highlight and promote their campaign around equality to connect with their audience, build awareness, and generate engagement.\n3. Magnolia\nAs the company behind the TV show Fixer Upper, Magnolia has developed a well-known, aspirational brand around their market, silos, home remodeling and design, and their bakery.\nOn their Instagram, you’ll find behind the scenes clips, highlights from events they’re hosting, design inspiration from some of the homes featured on the show, and also promos they’re having at their market (i.e.a discount on Jo’s favorite bag for her birthday.)\nAnother way that Magnolia connects with their audience is asking people to comment on their posts and getting testimonials from those who have attended events they’ve hosted.\nThey also use hashtags like #MagnoliaMarket and #Wacotown to get people engaged around a topic. If you’re not using hashtags, you should. Posts with two hashtags yield the most likes and comments from fans.\n4. Panera Bread\nI love all of the imagery Panera Bread uses to connect and engage their Instagram audience.\nWhile most of the photos are of products you can purchase from them. A huge campaign their Instagram has focused on is removing artificial preservatives from their food and putting them where they belong and that’s made clear through their various photos targeted not only towards their food, but also volunteers helping out the community.\nAlong with that campaign, they’re using the hashtags #mypanera and mentioning the link in the bio that will give you more information about the initiative they’ve made as a company.\n5. Halo Top Creamery\nWhile they post a ton of photos on new flavors they’ve introduced or even some collaborations they’ve done, they also use Instagram to engage with their audience by asking them to comment and tag a friend.\n6. Chobani\nAs a brand that sells a consumer product, you’re probably expecting their Instagram to feature it prominently. I certainly did.\nWhile that happens occasionally, one thing they frequently do is feature meals and recipes that were created with Chobani products.\nIf you want to find more recipes made from Chobani products, you can check out the hashtag #madewithchobani for posts posted by their customers.\n7. Levis\nWith festival season ramping up, it’s no surprise that Levi’s uses their Instagram to showcase their products. Paying attention to trends like this, this keeps their feed relevant and timely.\nAlso, a hashtag that you’ll routinely see on their posts is #LiveinLevis, where consumers like you can show off how they live life in their Levi jeans.\n8. Go Pro\nI love that 80% of their Instagram photos consist of user generated images. Allowing them to showcase the adventures and images their users have taken thanks to them.\nIf their posts, they also tell you how you can share you photos with them (by clicking the link in their bio).\n9. HubSpot\nThe majority of HubSpot’s Instagram consists of culture highlights, like, how you can bring your pet to work, book the nap room, enjoy a drink the beer garden, or check out a book. A really cool thing they do in its offices all over the world is employee takeover. During this, various members of their team, takeover the company Instagram for the day and post photos of their team and what it’s like for them to work at HubSpot.\n10. Pottery Barn\nAs you’ve realized by now, images on Instagram don’t always need to come from your brand, but rather your users and customers -- and that’s something Pottery Barn takes advantage of.\nBy showcasing their products through photos submitted by customers, they can show you how real customers have styled the items and added them to their homes. No professional camera or studio tricks; just a realistic vision of what their products could look like in your life.\n11. Fitbit\nFitbit recently launched their new Alta HR, their slimmest wristband with continuous heart rate. To promote the new product, they uploaded a group of photos, showcasing the different colors that can be purchased. No matter what activity you’re doing, Fitbit is all about moving and finding your fit.\nThey add variety to their Instagram feed by initiating conversations with their audience with their “Why do you fitbit series?”, they also make use of animation and video along side of real life photos.\n12. Milkcraft\nAlong with the taste bud tempting photos they post, something interesting Milkcraft (a local creamery here in CT) sometimes does on their Instagram is they ask you to review them on Zagat.\nAlso, if you want them to repost your photos on their account, you can add the hashtag #milkcraftct.\n13. Starbucks\nThere are a ton of new drinks regularly being introduced at Starbucks and Instagram is a great platform for them to showcase images of those drinks.\nFor example, I’m sure you’ve heard of the unicorn frappe craze.\nLike other brands mentioned above, Starbucks also reposts images curated by their customers.\nSo, maybe the time you’re at starbucks, don’t be afraid to post that picture. Go crazy and tag Starbucks!\n14. Juliana’s Pizza\nWhen it comes to food, there is nothing better than pizza! No matter what kind of toppings you like, Juliana’s pizza posts customer-curated photos that it hopes will convince you to take a trip to Brooklyn.\n15. Carats & Cake\nAs a platform for bringing together couples, vendors, and venues, Carats & Cake utilized their Instagram account to showcase those three elements.\nNot only do they geotag their photos, but they also include the location where the wedding took place, the photographer, and the florists as well as other vendors that might have been involved with the wedding.\nIf you love looking at wedding photography, you won’t be disappointed by following this brand.\n16. Vera Bradley\nWith Mother’s Day right around the corner, Vera Bradley took an interesting approach to their Instagram. They’re shouting out all of the mom’s who have supported us and made us into the adults we are.\nThey’re making their brand personal by building an emotional connection with their audience and posting timely content.\nThe best part … you can create your own thank you mom graphic. If you want to see all of the images that were posted, check out the hashtag #thankyoumoms.\n17. Gatorade\nGatorade is about being the fuel to power your game and their Instagram uses great imagery to highlight athletes and their dedication.\nOn almost every post you’ll find the hashtag #winfromwithin, making it a great way for the brand to connect with other athletes from around the world that are doing amazing things.\nWhen it comes to social media the best tactic is building engagement and a network of like minded, passionate individuals, and, by using a hashtag, you’re able to generate user-curated content easily.\n18. Old Spice\nOld Spice is a brand that people no doubt recognize.\nWhen you’re posting on Instagram, it’s important to keep your brand in tact and, that’s something Old Spice has delivered on.\nThey don’t lose any of their wit and humor, especially with the images and captions posted.\nA great example is their Simu-date-her, they hosted live on Facebook. They used Instagram to promote the live video and then added a link to their bio, so viewers could be directly straight to their Facebook post.\n19. Ben & Jerry’s\nWhat doesn’t Ben & Jerry’s post on their Instagram?\nMany of you won’t be surprised to learn that Ben & Jerry’s is participating in the People’s Climate March, which is prominently featured on their Instagram these days. They also share user generated content and they highlight promotions and products you can get from their store locations.\nLike Chobani, they also highlight recipes for items created using some of their products.\n20. Amazon\nWe’ve all seen that statistics of using puppies, babies, and kittens in your marketing, if you have a puppy or kitten, it’s no surprise that they love jumping in boxes, so why wouldn’t a brand make use of this!","Source: https://www.impactplus.com/blog/examples-of-businesses-using-instagram\nContent summary part#2: The text provides examples of 20 businesses that use Instagram to connect with their audience, promote their brand, and generate engagement. These businesses include Nike, Airbnb, Magnolia, Panera Bread, Halo Top Creamery, Chobani, Levi's, GoPro, HubSpot, Pottery Barn, Fitbit, Milkcraft, Starbucks, Juliana's Pizza, Carats & Cake, Vera Bradley, Gatorade, Old Spice, Ben & Jerry's, and Amazon.","Source: https://www.impactplus.com/blog/examples-of-businesses-using-instagram\nRaw content part#3: If you’re following Amazon, every once in awhile you’ll see a regram from their customers and their pets enjoying the boxes from their shipments. Also on Amazon’s Instagram, you might even find a great new product you didn’t even know existed.\n21. Walt Disney World\nYou’ll find that Disney World’s Instagram is a mix of their own and user-generated content showcasing the spirit and atmosphere of the theme park.\nThe images they use pull you into the nostalgia of visiting Disney World. Plus, their account gives you a glimpse into RunDisney and other events happening.\nIs There An Instagram Account I Missed?\nWith millions of Instagram accounts out there, I’m sure there’s a bunch I’ve missed. Which ones are your favorite? I’d love to know which brands on Instagram are knocking it out of the park! Or does your brand have any unique Instagram marketing tactics they’ve seen return from?

And half of Instagram users say the platform helps them discover new brands. Even better for brands, 44% of users shop weekly on the platform.\nIf you’re not using Instagram for business purposes, those potential new customers might never find their way to your products or services.\nHere’s how to use Instagram for business growth in 2023.\nBonus: Claim your free pack of 15 creative Instagram post templates made by Hootsuite’s professional graphic designers. Easily customize them in Canva, and start getting more engagement today.\nHow to set up Instagram for business in 4 steps\n1. Switch to a Business account\nYou need to create an Instagram account first, then convert it to a business account. If you have an existing personal or creator account you want to convert, that works too. It’s free and anyone can do it.\nYou can have up to five Instagram accounts, so go ahead and keep your personal Instagram account personal if that’s what you prefer.\nFrom your profile, tap the hamburger (three lines) menu icon in the upper-right corner.\nTap Settings. Some accounts may see Switch to professional account on this menu. If you do, tap it. Otherwise, tap Account, then tap Switch to professional account.\nTap Continue (you may need to tap it multiple times as Instagram previews the available features of a professional account).\nSelect a Category and use the slider to choose whether to show it on your profile, then tap Done.\nChoose Business (unless it makes sense for you to choose Creator), and tap Next.\nUse the slider to opt in or out of promotional emails from Instagram for professional accounts, then tap Next.\nAdd or edit relevant contact details, then use the slider to choose whether to show your contact information on your profile, then tap Next (or tap Don’t use my contact info to skip this step).\nIf you plan to connect your Instagram business account with a Facebook business page, follow the prompts to connect your account to your Facebook Page. This is technically optional, but it’s necessary in order to use Instagram shopping features or run ads on Instagram.\nTap the X in the top left corner to close this window and return to your profile.\nLearn more about the difference between Instagram business and creator accounts.\n2. Add business information to your bio\nIn 150 characters or less, your Instagram bio should describe your brand and showcase your brand voice. We’ve got a full guide to creating an effective Instagram bio for business (complete with templates), but here’s a quick video to walk you through the basics:\nAlso be sure to make the most of the other components of your Instagram business profile:\nProfile pic: Most brands use their logo. Your profile photo displays as 110 x 110 pixels (cropped to a circle), but it’s stored at 320 x 320, so that’s the size you should upload.\nLink in bio: Link to your website, your latest blog post, a current campaign or a Link Tree.\nContact information: If you didn’t add contact info during your account creation, you can do so at any time by tapping Edit profile. Instagram will then add a Contact button to your profile.\nAction buttons: If relevant, you can add a button that allows customers to book or reserve appointments or to order food. To use this feature, you need an account with one of Instagram’s partners. Tap Edit Profile, then scroll down to Action Buttons.\nStory highlights and covers: Instagram Story highlights are another way to maximize your profile real estate by providing more information about your brand or your products. Organize Stories into saved collections, then add some polish with Highlight covers.\n3. Connect your product catalog\nTo tag products in Instagram content, or to run certain kinds of Instagram ads, you need to create a product catalog. You can do this in Meta’s Commerce Manager.\nHead to Commerce Manager and click Get Started, then select Create a catalog and click Get started again.\nSelect Ecommerce, then click Next.\nIf you have a shop on an ecommerce platform like Shopify or Big Commerce, click Connect a partner platform and follow the prompts to create your catalog. Otherwise, click Upload product info, name your catalog and click Next.\nClick View catalog to open your catalog, then Add items to start adding products.\nWe’ve got a whole post on using Commerce Manager if you’d like more details on how this tool works.\n4. Turn on Instagram shopping\nOnce your catalog is full of products, it’s time to turn on Instagram’s shopping features.\nFrom your profile, tap the hamburger (three lines) menu icon in the upper-right corner.\nTap Settings, then Business, then Set up a Shop.\nTap Get started and follow the prompts to submit your shop for review.\nWait for approval. You can check the status of your shop at any time by going to Settings > Business >Shopping.\nOnce your shop is approved, go to Settings > Business >Shopping, select your product catalog and tap Done.\nWe’ve got a full blog post explaining everything you need to know about Instagram Shopping if you want to focus on this particular aspect of using Instagram for business.\nUsing Instagram for business: 6 tips\n1. Research your audience\nA good social media strategy starts with a sound understanding of your audience.\nInstagram’s audience demographics give you an overall picture of who uses the platform. For example, 18-34-year-olds represent the largest ad audience on the site.\nSource: Hootsuite Global State of Digital 2022 (October Update)\nHowever, that doesn’t mean your specific audience on Instagram will be made up of 18-to-34-year-olds. For example, looking at the audience insights for my own Instagram account, I can see that my audience skews older than the Instagram average:\nSource: Meta Business Suite","Source: https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-use-instagram-for-business/\nContent summary part#1: The text provides information on how to set up and use Instagram for business growth in 2023, including switching to a business account, adding business information to your bio, connecting your product catalog, and turning on Instagram shopping. The text also highlights the importance of researching your audience for a successful social media strategy.","Source: https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-use-instagram-for-business/\nRaw content part#2: You can find demographic information on your existing audience using Instagram Insights, Meta Business Suite, or Hootsuite Analytics. But if you’re just getting started using Instagram for business, you might not have a large enough following to gain meaningful insights here yet.\nIn that case, take a look at the demographics of your audience on other social channels and of your existing customer base. While this won’t translate exactly to Instagram, it should give you a sense of who’s interested in your business and what you have to say.\nUnderstanding your audience puts you in a better position to create targeted content and business captions for Instagram that resonate. Since audience research is an important foundation for your content strategy, we’ve got a whole post dedicated to helping you find your target market.\n2. Figure out your content mix\nNow that you know who your audience is, you need to determine what to share with them. Rather than posting random content whenever the mood strikes, you need to develop a content strategy that speaks to your audience and keeps them engaged, all while contributing to real business goals.\nWhile you should certainly post some promotional content to get people excited about your products and drive sales, you also need to provide content that builds community and sparks engagement.\nThat might mean including user-generated content or other curated resources, sharing insider expertise about your industry, or joining in on a trending meme. (But tread carefully here – only join in on trends that are appropriate for your brand voice.)\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Wendy's 🍔 (@wendys)\nLook for opportunities to develop themes or regular installments that you can build into a series. “Content buckets” allow you to check certain boxes without having to overthink creation. The more planning you do upfront, the better you’ll be able to produce regular content and respond to last-minute or unplanned events.\n3. Schedule your content in advance\nFrom Reels to Stories to posts, there are many options when it comes to Instagram content.\nThe best way to create a unified strategy is to schedule your content across all Instagram surfaces (and other social platforms) using a content calendar. Or, take it up a level and schedule all your content to publish automatically at the right time using a tool like the Hootsuite Publisher. Yes, you can even schedule Stories and Reels in advance.\nStart free 30-day trial\nThe added advantage here is that you can create your content in dedicated blocks of time and schedule it to post at the best time for your audience. Even if that time is outside business hours, on the weekend, or in the middle of the night.\n4. Tag products\nWhen you share content about your products on Instagram, tagging makes it much easier for people to learn more or buy. You can tag up to 20 products in a photo feed post.\nTo tag products, create your Instagram post or Reel as usual. Then, on the final screen before posting, tap Tag products. You can tag products from your own shop or someone else’s, which creates great opportunities for collaboration and cross-promotion.\nSource: @reitmans\nIn Stories, you can tag products using the Product link sticker.\nSource: @allbirds\n5. Track your results (and learn from wins and losses)\nWith an Instagram business profile, you have access to the platform’s built-in analytics tools to help you understand how well different types of content perform.\nThere are several other analytics tools available, including Hootsuite’s, that can track longer time frames, automate reporting and make it easier to compare Instagram metrics across other social media platforms.\nTry for free\nNo matter which social media marketing tools you use, the important thing is to check in regularly to learn what kind of content resonates best with your target audience. You’ll start to see patterns about what generates the most engagement, as well as what kinds of social media content increase views beyond your existing follower base. (Hint: Try Instagram Reels.)\nUse these lessons to hone your content strategy over time.\n6. Treat Instagram as a customer service channel\nSuccess on Instagram requires you to engage with your followers rather than just blast content out and hope someone likes it. One important component of this two-way communication is monitoring your DMs for questions, comments, and customer service requests.\nInstagram business accounts have access to a couple of DM features that make managing customer service easier on the platform. First, your inbox is divided into Primary and General tabs to make it easier to keep track of your messages. And second, you can create saved replies to commonly asked questions that you can access via keyboard shortcuts.\nHootsuite Inbox makes it even easier to manage your DMs by allowing you to assign messages to the appropriate team members. If you really want to take customer service on Instagram seriously, a tool like Sparkcentral allows you to integrate Instagram with your CRM.\nFAQs about using Instagram for business\nIs Instagram free for business?\nIt’s free to set up an Instagram business account, promote your business, and even set up an Instagram shop.\nThe only fees for Instagram business accounts are ad costs if you choose to run Instagram ads, and selling fees if you use Commerce Manager to allow your customers to check out and complete their purchase within the Meta platform.\nSo, there is no fee to use Instagram Shopping to tag products and direct users to your website to buy them. However, if you use Meta’s native checkout through Commerce Manager, you will pay the following selling fees:\n$0.40 for shipments up to $8.00\n5% for shipments of $8.01 or more\nInstagram is waiving these fees until 11:59 PST June 30, 2023.\nHow does Instagram work for business?\nAs you’ve seen in the Instagram for business tips throughout this post, Instagram offers many useful features for businesses. Some of the most important features only available for professional accounts are:\nInstagram Insights for audience demographics and details about how your content performs\nInstagram Shopping to tag products in your content\nInstagram Direct features to better manage DM communications\nBut on the whole, Instagram for businesses works just like it works for creators or personal accounts. Create great content that inspires, informs, or entertains your audience to grow your following and build community around your account.\nWhat are the disadvantages of using Instagram for business?\nFor most businesses, the benefits of using Instagram for business far outweigh the disadvantages. That said, there is one important disadvantage that’s especially important when using Instagram for small business development.\nFor micro businesses, it can be tempting to use Instagram as your entire business presence. But this puts you at risk if you ever have an issue with your account, like being hacked, locked out, or blocked. It’s a good idea to also have a website you control where you can continue to make sales and grow your audience if there’s ever a problem with your Instagram business account.\nSave time managing Instagram for business using Hootsuite.
